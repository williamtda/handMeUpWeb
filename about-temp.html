	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p><strong>The fight to reduce food wastage and combat world hunger starts with you.</strong></p>
	<p>Our <strong>mobile app</strong> aims to organize motivated volunteers to deliver food that would otherwise be wasted
  by markets and restaurants to nearby food shelters and soup kitchens. Local communities need food, and markets need a way
  to deliver them. That\'s where you come in.</p><p>Select from a list of new deliveries on your dashboard that local markets =
  have set up with food pantries. Google Maps directions are provided, as well as any relevant information about the two parties.</p>
	<p>If you run a restaurant, supermarket, or food shelter, apply to this service using the navigational links above</a>
